## Summary

This KEP adds support to use user-namespaces in pods.

## Motivation

From
[user_namespaces(7)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/user_namespaces.7.html):
> User namespaces isolate security-related identifiers and attributes, in
particular, user IDs and group IDs, the root directory, keys, and capabilities.
A process's user and group IDs can be different inside and outside a user
namespace. In particular, a process can have a normal unprivileged user ID
outside a user namespace while at the same time having a user ID of 0 inside the
namespace; in other words, the process has full privileges for operations inside
the user namespace, but is unprivileged for operations outside the namespace.

The goal of supporting user namespaces in Kubernetes is to be able to run
processes in pods with a different user and group IDs than in the host.
Specifically, a privileged process in the pod runs as an unprivileged process in
the host. If such a process is able to break out of the container to the host,
it'll have limited impact as it'll be running as an unprivileged user there.

The following security vulnerabilities are (completely or partially) mitigated
with user namespaces as we propose here and it is expected that it will mitigate
similar future vulnerabilities too.
- [CVE-2019-5736](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-5736): Host runc binary can be overwritten from container. Completely mitigated with userns.
  - Score: [8.6 (HIGH)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-5736)

- [Azurescape](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/azure-container-instances/):
  Completely mitigated with userns, at least as it was found (needs CVE-2019-5736). This is the **first cross-account container takeover in the public cloud**.

### Goals

Here we use UIDs, but the same applies for GIDs.

- Increase node to pod isolation by mapping user and group IDs
  inside the container to different IDs in the host. In particular, mapping root
  inside the container to unprivileged user and group IDs in the node.
- Increase pod to pod isolation by allowing to use non-overlapping mappings
  (UIDs/GIDs) whenever possible. IOW, if two containers runs as user X, they run
  as different UIDs in the node and therefore are more isolated than today.
  See phase 3 for limitations.
- Allow pods to have capabilities (e.g. `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`) that are only valid in
  the pod (not valid in the host).
- Benefit from the security hardening that user namespaces provide against some
  of the future unknown runtime and kernel vulnerabilities.

### Non-Goals

- Provide a way to run the kubelet process or container runtimes as an
  unprivileged process. Although initiatives like [kubelet in user
  namespaces][kubelet-userns] and this KEP both make use of user namespaces, it is
  a different implementation for a different purpose.
- Implement all the very nice use cases that user namespaces allows. The goal
  here is to allow them as incremental improvements, not implement all the
  possible ideas related with user namespaces.

[kubelet-userns]: https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/2033-kubelet-in-userns-aka-rootless

## Proposal

This KEP adds a new `hostUsers` field  to `pod.Spec` to allow to enable/disable
using user namespaces for pods.

This proposal aims to support running pods inside user namespaces. This will
improve the pod to node isolation (phase 1 and 2) and pod to pod isolation
(phase 3) we currently have.

This mitigates all the vulnerabilities listed in the motivation section.

### User Stories

#### Story 1

As a cluster admin, I want run some pods with privileged capabilities because
the applications in the pods require it (e.g. `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` to mount a FUSE
filesystem or `CAP_NET_ADMIN` to setup a VPN) but I don't want this extra
capability to grant me any extra privileges on the host or other pods.

#### Story 2

As a cluster admin, I want to allow some pods to run in the host user namespace
if they need a feature only available in such user namespace, such as loading a
kernel module with `CAP_SYS_MODULE`.

#### Story 3

As a cluster admin, I want to allow users to run their container as root
without that process having root privileges on the host, so I can mitigate the
impact of a compromised container.

#### Story 4

As a cluster admin, I want to allow users to choose the user/group they use
inside the container without it being the user/group they use on the node, so I
can mitigate the impact of a container breakout vulnerability (e.g to read
host files).

#### Story 5

As a cluster admin, I want to use different host UIDs/GIDs for pods running on
the same node (whenever kernel/kube features allow it), so I can mitigate the
impact a compromised pod can have on other pods and the node itself.

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats

#### UID space

#### Volume support

### Risks and Mitigations

## Design Details

### Pod.spec changes

The following changes will be done to the pod.spec:

- `pod.spec.hostUsers`: bool.
If true or not present, uses the host user namespace (as today)
If false, a new userns is created for the pod.
By default it is set to `true`.

### Phases

We propose to divide the work in 3 phases. Each phase makes this work with
either more isolation or more workloads. When no support is yet added to handle
some workload, a clear error will be shown.

PLEASE note that only phase 1 is targeted for alpha. Also note that the missing
details (CRI changes, changes needed in container runtimes, etc.) will be added
in a follow-up PRs.

Please note the last sub-section here is a table with the summary of the changes
proposed on each phase. That table is not updated (it is from the initial
proposal, doesn't have all the feedback and adjustments we discussed) but can
still be useful as a general overview.


#### Phase 1: pods "without" volumes

This phase makes pods "without" volume work with user namespaces. This is
activated via the bool `pod.spec.HostUsers` and can only be set to `false`
on pods which use either no volumes or only volumes of the following types:

 - configmap
 - secret
 - downwardAPI
 - emptyDir
 - projected

This list of volumes was chosen as they can't be used to share files with other
pods.

The mapping length will be 65535, mapping the range 0-65534 to the pod. This wide
range makes sure most workloads will work fine.

The mapping will be chosen by the kubelet, using a simple algorithm to give
different pods in this category ("without" volumes) a non-overlapping mapping.
Giving non-overlapping mappings generates the best isolation for pods.

Furthermore, the node UID space of 2^32 can hold up to 2^16 pods each with a
mapping length of 65535 (2^16-1) top. This imposes a limit of 65k pods per node,
but that is not an issue we will hit in practice for a long time, if ever (today
we run 110 pods per node by default).

#### Phase 2: pods with volumes

This phase makes user namespaces work in pods with volumes too. This is
activated via the bool `pod.spec.HostUsers` too and pods fall into this mode if
some other volume type than the ones listed for phase 1 is used. IOW, when phase
2 is implemented, pods that use volume types not supported in phase 1, fall into
the phase 2.

All pods in this mode will use _the same_ mapping, chosen by the kubelet, with a
length 65535, and mapping the range 0-65534 too. IOW, each pod will have its own user
namespace, but they will map to _the same_ UIDs/GIDs in the host.

Using the same mapping allows for pods to share files and mitigates all the
listed vulnerabilities (as the host is protected from the container). It is also
a trivial next-step to take, given that we have phase 1 implemented: just return
the same mapping if the pod has other volumes.

#### Phase 3: TBD

#### Unresolved

Here is a list of considerations raised in PRs discussion that hasn't yet
settle. This list is not exhaustive, we are just trying to put the things that
we don't want to forget or want to highlight it. Some things that are obvious we
need to tackle are not listed. Let us know if you think it is important to add
something else to this list:

- We will start with mappings of 64K. Tim Hockin, however, has expressed
  concerns. See more info on [this Github discussion](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3065#discussion_r781676224)
  SergeyKanzhelev [suggested a nice alternative](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3065#discussion_r807408134),
  to limit the number of pods so we guarantee enough spare host UIDs in case we
  need them for the future. There is no final decision yet on how to handle this.

- Tim suggested we should try to not use the whole UID space. Something to keep
  in mind for next revisions. More info [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3065#discussion_r797100081)

- While we said that if support is not implemented we will throw a clear error,
  we have not said if it will be API-rejected at admission time or what. I'd
  like to see how that code looks like before promising something. Was raised [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3065#discussion_r798730922)

- Tim suggested that we might want to allow the container runtimes to choose
  the mapping and have different runtimes pick different mappings. While KEP
  authors disagree on this, we still need to discuss it and settle on something.
  This was [raised here](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3065#discussion_r798760382)

- (will clarify later with Tim what he really means here). Tim [raised this](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3065#discussion_r798766024): do
  we actually want to ship phase 2 as automatic thing? If we do, any workloads
  that use it can't ever switch to whatever we do in phase 3

### Summary of the Proposed Changes

[This table](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1z4oiZ7v4DjWpZQI2kbFbI8Q6botFaA07KJYaKA-vZpg/edit#slide=id.gfd10976c8b_1_41) gives you a quick overview of each phase (note it is outdated, but still useful for a general overview).


### Test Plan

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*

Consider the following in developing a test plan for this enhancement:
- Will there be e2e and integration tests, in addition to unit tests?
- How will it be tested in isolation vs with other components?

No need to outline all of the test cases, just the general strategy. Anything
that would count as tricky in the implementation, and anything particularly
challenging to test, should be called out.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations). Please adhere to the [Kubernetes testing guidelines][testing-guidelines]
when drafting this test plan.

TBD

### Graduation Criteria

Note this section is a WIP yet.

##### Alpha
- Phase 1 implemented

##### Beta

- Make plans on whether, when, and how to enable by default
- Should we reconsider making the mappings smaller by default?
- Should we allow any way for users to for "more" IDs mapped? If yes, how many more and how?
- Should we allow the user to ask for specific mappings?
